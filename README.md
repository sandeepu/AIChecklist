# The AI Checklist

85% of AI projects never get to deployment! From the projects that get deployed, only 60% ever deliver on their promised impact! In a typical AI team today, not everyone is at the same level of experience required for building successful AI products. Team members vary in their experience with statistics, model foundations, data wrangling, operations, deployment, and product design thinking. 

In building dozens of Data+AI products, there are common patterns I have seen play out in failed products. The mistakes made were not because of ineptitude but rather because of improper use of what the team already knew but did missed to apply. 
To address this gap, I have been exploring techniques followed in other complex tasks such as performing surgeries, building scrapers, flying airplanes, etc., to get things right and deliver consistent results. In the best-selling book The Checklist manifesto, author Atul Gawande covers his reseach across multiple fields on the role of checklists in getting things right for complex activities.

This project is an attempt to create a AI Checklist that we can use as a community. The vision is to make AI accessible to everyone, and leverage for the benefit of humankind.
