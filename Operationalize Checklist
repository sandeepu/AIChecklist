Operationalize Checklist

1. Verify data pipelines for generating time-dependent features are performant for low latency
2. Verify validation tests exist for data pipelines
3. Verify model performance for the individual data slices
4. Avoid using two different programming languages between training and serving
5. Ensure appropriate model scaling such that inference threshold is within threshold
6. Verify data quality inconsistencies are checked at source, ingestion into the lake, and ETL processing
7. Verify cloud spend associated with the AI product is within budget.
8. Ensure optimization phase to balance quality with model depth and width
9. Verify monitoring for data and concept drift
10. Verify unnecessary calibration layers have been removed
11. Verify there is monitoring to detect slow poisoning of the model due to intermittent errors
