Design Checklist

1. Ensure feature crossing is experimented before jumping to non-linear models (as applicable)
2. Verify there is no feature leakage
3. Verify new features are added to the model with justification documented on how they increase the model quality
4. Verify features are correctly scaled
5. Verify simpler traditional ML models are tried before using deep learning
6. Ensure hashing is applied for sparse features (as applicable)
7. Verify model dimensionality reduction was experimented
8. Verify classification threshold tuning (in logistic regression) takes into account business impact
9. Verify regularization or early stopping in logistic regression is applied (as applicable)
10. Apply embeddings to translate large sparse vectors into a lower-dimensional space (while preserving semantic relationships)
11. Verify model freshness requirements based on the problem requirements
12. Verify the impact of features that were discarded for being applicable only to a small fraction of data
13. Check if feature count is proportional to amount of data available for model training
